This project is an implementation of an "algorithm" described in Ray Dalio's video "How the economic machine works". However, it cannot be treated as an investment advice or recommendation.

## Indicators

Ray Dalio's "How the Economic Machine Works" provides a framework for understanding economic cycles. It helps to assess the current economic cycle based on key indicators such as: GDP growth, interest rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. Below there is a description of each phase of the economic cycle in relation to these indicators.

1. **Current GDP Growth**: If GDP growth is high, it suggests economic expansion. If it's slowing down, it might indicate reaching a peak or entering a recession. If it's negative, it could signify a recession or depression.

2. **Current Interest Rate**: Central banks often adjust interest rates to influence economic activity. Low-interest rates typically stimulate borrowing and spending, fueling economic expansion. High-interest rates can cool down the economy and lead to a slowdown.

3. **Current Inflation Rate**: Moderate inflation is often a sign of a healthy economy, indicating demand without excessive price increases. High inflation might prompt central banks to raise interest rates to curb it, potentially leading to a peak or recession. Deflation, on the other hand, can signal economic weakness.

4. **Current Unemployment Rate**: Low unemployment rates suggest a strong economy with ample job opportunities, characteristic of an expansion phase. Rising unemployment can indicate a slowdown or recession, while persistently high unemployment may signal a depression.

## Economic phases

Below is a description of each phase of the economic cycle in relation to these indicators:

1. **Expansion**: During an expansion, GDP growth is robust, typically above the long-term trend. Interest rates are often low or gradually rising, as central banks aim to prevent overheating. Inflation remains moderate, and the unemployment rate declines as businesses expand and hire more workers.

2. **Peak**: At the peak of the cycle, GDP growth may start to slow down from its peak levels. Interest rates might rise as central banks try to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from accelerating too rapidly. Inflation could be inching higher, and the unemployment rate may be at its lowest point as the economy nears full capacity.

3. **Recession**: A recession is characterized by negative GDP growth, often accompanied by rising unemployment and subdued inflation. Interest rates may start to decline as central banks aim to stimulate economic activity. Consumer and business confidence typically wane during this phase, leading to reduced spending and investment.

4. **Depression**: A depression is an extreme and prolonged economic downturn characterized by severe contraction in economic activity, plummeting GDP, soaring unemployment rates, and potentially deflation. Interest rates may hit historically low levels as central banks attempt to stimulate demand, but conventional monetary policy tools may prove insufficient.

5. **Trough**: The trough marks the bottom of the economic cycle, where economic activity reaches its lowest point. GDP growth may stabilize or begin to turn positive, albeit at a slow pace. Interest rates may remain low as policymakers continue efforts to spur recovery. Unemployment rates may start to plateau, signaling the beginning of a potential turnaround.

6. **Recovery**: During the recovery phase, economic indicators start to improve. GDP growth accelerates, supported by increasing consumer and business confidence. Interest rates may gradually rise as the economy gains momentum and inflationary pressures build. Unemployment rates begin to decline as businesses resume hiring, paving the way for a new expansion phase.

Assessing the current economic cycle would require detailed analysis of these indicators and broader economic trends, taking into account global economic conditions, policy responses, and other factors influencing the economy.

## Monetary policy

Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to manage the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability, full employment, and economic growth. Central banks influence economic conditions through changes in interest rates, open market operations, and other tools at their disposal like quantitative easing.

1. **Accommodative Monetary Policy**: Central banks implement accommodative policies to stimulate borrowing, investment, and economic activity. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Interest rates are low or decreasing. Quantitative Easing (QE) is enabled during periods of economic weakness, used to further lower long-term interest rates and inject liquidity into the financial system.

2. **Tight Monetary Policy**:Central banks adopt a tight policy stance to control inflation or prevent an overheating economy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can reduce spending and investment. Interest rates are high or increasing. Quantitative Easing is not enabled during a tight monetary policy stance, as central banks aim to tighten monetary conditions.

3. **Hawkish Monetary Policy**: Central banks adopt a hawkish stance to combat inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates aim to moderate economic growth and inflation. Interest rates are expected to rise or are being raised. Quantitative Easing is not enabled, as central banks may taper or halt QE programs to normalize monetary policy.

4. **Dovish Monetary Policy**: Central banks adopt a dovish stance to support economic growth and employment. Lower interest rates stimulate borrowing and spending. Interest rates are expected to decrease or are lowered.Quantitative Easing is often enabled during a dovish stance, especially when interest rates are already low, to provide further support to financial markets and economic activity.

## Asset classes and dominant drivers

Here is how dominant drivers such as productivity growth, debt levels, global trade state, and monetary policy affect investing in various asset classes:

1. **Stocks/ETFs**:
   - **Economic Cycle**: During the expansion phase, stocks tend to perform well as corporate profits grow. However, during recessions or depressions, stock prices may decline due to decreased consumer spending and business investment.
   - **Productivity Growth**: Higher productivity can lead to increased profitability for companies, positively impacting stock prices.
   - **Debt Levels**: High levels of corporate debt may pose risks during economic downturns, affecting stock prices negatively.
   - **Global Trade State**: Stocks of multinational corporations can be affected by changes in global trade policies or geopolitical tensions.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Accommodative monetary policy, such as low interest rates and quantitative easing, can boost stock prices by stimulating economic growth.

2. **Real Estate / REITs**:
   - **Economic Cycle**: Real estate tends to perform well during economic expansions as demand for properties increases. However, during recessions or depressions, real estate values may decline due to reduced demand and increased defaults.
   - **Productivity Growth**: Higher productivity can drive demand for commercial real estate and boost rental income.
   - **Debt Levels**: High levels of mortgage debt can increase the risk of defaults and foreclosures, negatively impacting real estate values.
   - **Global Trade State**: Real estate markets in regions heavily dependent on global trade may be influenced by changes in trade policies and economic conditions.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Lower interest rates can make borrowing for real estate investments more attractive, boosting property prices and REIT performance.

3. **Precious Metals**:
   - **Economic Cycle**: Precious metals like gold often serve as safe-haven assets during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty, leading to increased demand and higher prices.
   - **Productivity Growth**: Productivity growth may have a limited direct impact on precious metal prices, but it can indirectly affect investor sentiment and demand for safe-haven assets.
   - **Debt Levels**: High levels of government debt or inflationary pressures may increase demand for precious metals as a hedge against currency devaluation.
   - **Global Trade State**: Precious metal prices can be influenced by changes in global trade dynamics, especially if trade tensions lead to increased market volatility.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Loose monetary policy and concerns about currency devaluation can drive investors towards precious metals as a store of value.

4. **Bonds**:
   - **Economic Cycle**: Bond prices tend to rise during economic downturns as investors seek safe-haven assets, leading to lower yields. Conversely, during economic expansions, bond prices may decline as yields rise.
   - **Productivity Growth**: Higher productivity growth can lead to higher inflation expectations, which may negatively impact bond prices and increase yields.
   - **Debt Levels**: High levels of government debt can raise concerns about creditworthiness, potentially leading to higher bond yields.
   - **Global Trade State**: Changes in global trade dynamics can affect bond markets through their impact on inflation, interest rates, and investor sentiment.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Monetary policy decisions, such as changes in interest rates and bond-buying programs, directly influence bond prices and yields.

5. **Cash**:
   - **Economic Cycle**: Cash is often viewed as a defensive asset during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty when investors seek liquidity and capital preservation.
   - **Productivity Growth**: Productivity growth may have limited direct impact on cash investments, but it can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite.
   - **Debt Levels**: High levels of debt may increase investor preference for cash as a safe-haven asset during times of financial stress.
   - **Global Trade State**: Changes in global trade conditions can affect investor confidence and lead to shifts towards cash as a temporary safe haven.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Central bank policies, such as interest rate decisions and liquidity injections, can impact the attractiveness of holding cash relative to other investments.

6. **Cryptocurrencies**:
   - **Economic Cycle**: Cryptocurrencies are often considered speculative assets and may experience heightened volatility during economic downturns. However, they may also be seen as alternative stores of value during times of uncertainty.
   - **Productivity Growth**: Productivity growth may indirectly impact cryptocurrencies through its influence on investor sentiment and risk appetite.
   - **Debt Levels**: High levels of debt and concerns about currency devaluation can drive demand for cryptocurrencies as a hedge against traditional financial systems.
   - **Global Trade State**: Cryptocurrency markets can be influenced by global trade dynamics, especially if trade tensions lead to increased market volatility and risk aversion.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Loose monetary policies and concerns about fiat currency devaluation may drive demand for cryptocurrencies as decentralized alternatives.

In summary, various factors such as the economic cycle, productivity growth, debt levels, global trade dynamics, and monetary policy decisions play significant roles in shaping investment opportunities and risks across different asset classes. Investors need to carefully consider these factors when constructing their portfolios and adjusting their investment strategies to navigate changing market conditions.
