This project is an implementation of an "algorithm" described in Ray Dalio's video "How the economic machine works". However, it cannot be treated as an investment advice or recommendation.

## Indicators

Ray Dalio's "How the Economic Machine Works" provides a framework for understanding economic cycles. It helps to assess the current economic cycle based on key indicators such as: GDP growth, interest rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. Below there is a description of each phase of the economic cycle in relation to these indicators.

1. **Current GDP Growth**: If GDP growth is high, it suggests economic expansion. If it's slowing down, it might indicate reaching a peak or entering a recession. If it's negative, it could signify a recession or depression.

2. **Current Interest Rate**: Central banks often adjust interest rates to influence economic activity. Low-interest rates typically stimulate borrowing and spending, fueling economic expansion. High-interest rates can cool down the economy and lead to a slowdown.

3. **Current Inflation Rate**: Moderate inflation is often a sign of a healthy economy, indicating demand without excessive price increases. High inflation might prompt central banks to raise interest rates to curb it, potentially leading to a peak or recession. Deflation, on the other hand, can signal economic weakness.

4. **Current Unemployment Rate**: Low unemployment rates suggest a strong economy with ample job opportunities, characteristic of an expansion phase. Rising unemployment can indicate a slowdown or recession, while persistently high unemployment may signal a depression.

## Economic phases

Below is a description of each phase of the economic cycle in relation to these indicators:

1. **Expansion**: During an expansion, GDP growth is robust, typically above the long-term trend. Interest rates are often low or gradually rising, as central banks aim to prevent overheating. Inflation remains moderate, and the unemployment rate declines as businesses expand and hire more workers.

2. **Peak**: At the peak of the cycle, GDP growth may start to slow down from its peak levels. Interest rates might rise as central banks try to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from accelerating too rapidly. Inflation could be inching higher, and the unemployment rate may be at its lowest point as the economy nears full capacity.

3. **Recession**: A recession is characterized by negative GDP growth, often accompanied by rising unemployment and subdued inflation. Interest rates may start to decline as central banks aim to stimulate economic activity. Consumer and business confidence typically wane during this phase, leading to reduced spending and investment.

4. **Depression**: A depression is an extreme and prolonged economic downturn characterized by severe contraction in economic activity, plummeting GDP, soaring unemployment rates, and potentially deflation. Interest rates may hit historically low levels as central banks attempt to stimulate demand, but conventional monetary policy tools may prove insufficient.

5. **Trough**: The trough marks the bottom of the economic cycle, where economic activity reaches its lowest point. GDP growth may stabilize or begin to turn positive, albeit at a slow pace. Interest rates may remain low as policymakers continue efforts to spur recovery. Unemployment rates may start to plateau, signaling the beginning of a potential turnaround.

6. **Recovery**: During the recovery phase, economic indicators start to improve. GDP growth accelerates, supported by increasing consumer and business confidence. Interest rates may gradually rise as the economy gains momentum and inflationary pressures build. Unemployment rates begin to decline as businesses resume hiring, paving the way for a new expansion phase.

Assessing the current economic cycle would require detailed analysis of these indicators and broader economic trends, taking into account global economic conditions, policy responses, and other factors influencing the economy.

## Monetary policy

Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to manage the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability, full employment, and economic growth. Central banks influence economic conditions through changes in interest rates, open market operations, and other tools at their disposal like quantitative easing.

1. **Accommodative Monetary Policy**: Central banks implement accommodative policies to stimulate borrowing, investment, and economic activity. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Interest rates are low or decreasing. Quantitative Easing (QE) is enabled during periods of economic weakness, used to further lower long-term interest rates and inject liquidity into the financial system.

2. **Tight Monetary Policy**:Central banks adopt a tight policy stance to control inflation or prevent an overheating economy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can reduce spending and investment. Interest rates are high or increasing. Quantitative Easing is not enabled during a tight monetary policy stance, as central banks aim to tighten monetary conditions.

3. **Hawkish Monetary Policy**: Central banks adopt a hawkish stance to combat inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates aim to moderate economic growth and inflation. Interest rates are expected to rise or are being raised. Quantitative Easing is not enabled, as central banks may taper or halt QE programs to normalize monetary policy.

4. **Dovish Monetary Policy**: Central banks adopt a dovish stance to support economic growth and employment. Lower interest rates stimulate borrowing and spending. Interest rates are expected to decrease or are lowered.Quantitative Easing is often enabled during a dovish stance, especially when interest rates are already low, to provide further support to financial markets and economic activity.

## Asset classes and dominant drivers

Here is how dominant drivers such as productivity growth, debt levels, global trade state, and monetary policy affect investing in various asset classes:

1. **Stocks/ETFs**:
   - *Economic Cycle*: Stocks tend to perform well during the expansion and recovery phases of the economic cycle as corporate earnings grow. Conversely, they may underperform during recessions and depressions.
   - *Productivity Growth*: High productivity growth can positively impact corporate earnings and stock prices.
   - *Debt Levels*: Excessive corporate debt can increase financial risk and weigh down stock performance, especially during economic downturns.
   - *Global Trade State*: Stocks of companies with significant exposure to global markets may be affected by changes in global trade dynamics.
   - *Monetary Policy*: Accommodative monetary policy tends to be favorable for stocks, as low interest rates stimulate borrowing and investment. Tight or hawkish monetary policy may dampen stock market returns.

2. **Real Estate/REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**:
   - *Economic Cycle*: Real estate typically performs well during expansion phases when demand for property increases. However, it can suffer during recessions and depressions due to declining demand and property values.
   - *Productivity Growth*: Improvements in productivity can drive demand for commercial real estate, positively impacting REITs.
   - *Debt Levels*: High levels of debt in the real estate sector can increase vulnerability to economic downturns and interest rate hikes.
   - *Global Trade State*: International real estate markets may be influenced by global trade conditions, particularly in areas with high foreign investment.
   - *Monetary Policy*: Accommodative monetary policy can support real estate by keeping borrowing costs low, while tight monetary policy may increase financing costs and reduce demand.

3. **Precious Metals**:
   - *Economic Cycle*: Precious metals like gold and silver tend to perform well during economic uncertainty and periods of market volatility, making them attractive during recessions and depressions.
   - *Productivity Growth*: Productivity growth typically has a minimal direct impact on precious metals.
   - *Debt Levels*: High levels of debt and economic instability can increase demand for precious metals as safe-haven assets.
   - *Global Trade State*: Global trade tensions or geopolitical uncertainties may increase demand for precious metals as a hedge against currency fluctuations.
   - *Monetary Policy*: Accommodative monetary policy, especially if it leads to currency devaluation or inflationary concerns, can drive investors towards precious metals as stores of value.

4. **Bonds**:
   - *Economic Cycle*: Bonds are often seen as safer investments during periods of economic uncertainty, making them attractive during recessions and depressions.
   - *Productivity Growth*: Productivity growth can influence bond yields, with higher productivity potentially leading to higher interest rates.
   - *Debt Levels*: High levels of government or corporate debt can impact bond prices and yields, especially if there are concerns about default risk.
   - *Global Trade State*: Changes in global trade conditions can affect investor sentiment and demand for bonds issued by countries or companies with exposure to international markets.
   - *Monetary Policy*: Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates, so accommodative monetary policy with low interest rates tends to support bond prices, while tight monetary policy can lead to lower bond prices and higher yields.

5. **Cash**:
   - *Economic Cycle*: Cash provides liquidity and safety during periods of economic uncertainty, making it a preferred asset during recessions and depressions.
   - *Productivity Growth*: Productivity growth has minimal direct impact on cash holdings.
   - *Debt Levels*: High levels of debt can increase financial risk, making cash a more attractive option during times of heightened economic instability.
   - *Global Trade State*: Changes in global trade conditions may indirectly affect investor sentiment and confidence in holding cash.
   - *Monetary Policy*: Cash holdings offer stability during periods of tight monetary policy when interest rates are rising, as they can be quickly deployed into higher-yielding assets when opportunities arise.

6. **Cryptocurrencies**:
   - *Economic Cycle*: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative assets, often driven by investor sentiment rather than economic fundamentals. They may see increased interest during economic downturns as investors seek alternative stores of value.
   - *Productivity Growth*: Cryptocurrencies are not directly tied to productivity growth but may be influenced by technological advancements and adoption rates.
   - *Debt Levels*: High levels of debt and economic uncertainty can drive interest in cryptocurrencies as decentralized assets not tied to traditional financial systems.
   - *Global Trade State*: Global trade conditions may indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets through changes in investor sentiment and risk appetite.
   - *Monetary Policy*: Cryptocurrencies are often seen as inflation hedges or alternatives to traditional fiat currencies, so accommodative monetary policy that leads to concerns about currency devaluation can increase demand for cryptocurrencies.

In summary, investing in different asset classes is influenced by a combination of factors including the economic cycle, productivity growth, debt levels, global trade dynamics, and monetary policy. Each asset class responds differently to these drivers, and investors often adjust their portfolios based on their risk tolerance, investment goals, and expectations for future market conditions.
