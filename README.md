This project is an implementation of an "algorithm" described in Ray Dalio's video "How the economic machine works". However, it cannot be treated as an investment advice or recommendation.

## Indicators

Ray Dalio's "How the Economic Machine Works" provides a framework for understanding economic cycles. It helps to assess the current economic cycle based on key indicators such as: GDP growth, interest rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. Below there is a description of each phase of the economic cycle in relation to these indicators.

1. **Current GDP Growth**: If GDP growth is high, it suggests economic expansion. If it's slowing down, it might indicate reaching a peak or entering a recession. If it's negative, it could signify a recession or depression.

2. **Current Interest Rate**: Central banks often adjust interest rates to influence economic activity. Low-interest rates typically stimulate borrowing and spending, fueling economic expansion. High-interest rates can cool down the economy and lead to a slowdown.

3. **Current Inflation Rate**: Moderate inflation is often a sign of a healthy economy, indicating demand without excessive price increases. High inflation might prompt central banks to raise interest rates to curb it, potentially leading to a peak or recession. Deflation, on the other hand, can signal economic weakness.

4. **Current Unemployment Rate**: Low unemployment rates suggest a strong economy with ample job opportunities, characteristic of an expansion phase. Rising unemployment can indicate a slowdown or recession, while persistently high unemployment may signal a depression.

## Economic phases

Below is a description of each phase of the economic cycle in relation to these indicators:

1. **Expansion**: During an expansion, GDP growth is robust, typically above the long-term trend. Interest rates are often low or gradually rising, as central banks aim to prevent overheating. Inflation remains moderate, and the unemployment rate declines as businesses expand and hire more workers.

2. **Peak**: At the peak of the cycle, GDP growth may start to slow down from its peak levels. Interest rates might rise as central banks try to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from accelerating too rapidly. Inflation could be inching higher, and the unemployment rate may be at its lowest point as the economy nears full capacity.

3. **Recession**: A recession is characterized by negative GDP growth, often accompanied by rising unemployment and subdued inflation. Interest rates may start to decline as central banks aim to stimulate economic activity. Consumer and business confidence typically wane during this phase, leading to reduced spending and investment.

4. **Depression**: A depression is an extreme and prolonged economic downturn characterized by severe contraction in economic activity, plummeting GDP, soaring unemployment rates, and potentially deflation. Interest rates may hit historically low levels as central banks attempt to stimulate demand, but conventional monetary policy tools may prove insufficient.

5. **Trough**: The trough marks the bottom of the economic cycle, where economic activity reaches its lowest point. GDP growth may stabilize or begin to turn positive, albeit at a slow pace. Interest rates may remain low as policymakers continue efforts to spur recovery. Unemployment rates may start to plateau, signaling the beginning of a potential turnaround.

6. **Recovery**: During the recovery phase, economic indicators start to improve. GDP growth accelerates, supported by increasing consumer and business confidence. Interest rates may gradually rise as the economy gains momentum and inflationary pressures build. Unemployment rates begin to decline as businesses resume hiring, paving the way for a new expansion phase.

Assessing the current economic cycle would require detailed analysis of these indicators and broader economic trends, taking into account global economic conditions, policy responses, and other factors influencing the economy.

## Monetary policy

Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to manage the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability, full employment, and economic growth. Central banks influence economic conditions through changes in interest rates, open market operations, and other tools at their disposal like quantitative easing.

1. **Accommodative Monetary Policy**: Central banks implement accommodative policies to stimulate borrowing, investment, and economic activity. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Interest rates are low or decreasing. Quantitative Easing (QE) is enabled during periods of economic weakness, used to further lower long-term interest rates and inject liquidity into the financial system.

2. **Tight Monetary Policy**:Central banks adopt a tight policy stance to control inflation or prevent an overheating economy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can reduce spending and investment. Interest rates are high or increasing. Quantitative Easing is not enabled during a tight monetary policy stance, as central banks aim to tighten monetary conditions.

3. **Hawkish Monetary Policy**: Central banks adopt a hawkish stance to combat inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates aim to moderate economic growth and inflation. Interest rates are expected to rise or are being raised. Quantitative Easing is not enabled, as central banks may taper or halt QE programs to normalize monetary policy.

4. **Dovish Monetary Policy**: Central banks adopt a dovish stance to support economic growth and employment. Lower interest rates stimulate borrowing and spending. Interest rates are expected to decrease or are lowered.Quantitative Easing is often enabled during a dovish stance, especially when interest rates are already low, to provide further support to financial markets and economic activity.

## Asset classes and dominant drivers

Here is how dominant drivers such as productivity growth, debt levels, global trade state, and monetary policy affect investing in various asset classes:

1. **Stocks/ETFs**:
   - **Productivity Growth**: Higher productivity growth can lead to increased corporate earnings and stock prices over the long term, making stocks more attractive investments.
   - **Debt Levels**: High debt levels may increase corporate borrowing costs and reduce profitability, potentially impacting stock prices negatively.
   - **Global Trade State**: Stocks of companies heavily reliant on global trade may be affected by trade tensions or disruptions, while those with diversified revenue streams may be more resilient.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Accommodative monetary policy with low interest rates typically boosts stock prices by encouraging borrowing and investment. Tightening monetary policy, on the other hand, may lead to higher borrowing costs and could dampen stock market returns.

2. **Real Estate / REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**:
   - **Productivity Growth**: Productivity growth can positively impact real estate values, especially in areas where demand for office space or industrial facilities is driven by technological advancements.
   - **Debt Levels**: High debt levels can increase financing costs for real estate investors and may lead to liquidity issues during economic downturns.
   - **Global Trade State**: Real estate markets in regions heavily dependent on global trade may experience volatility due to shifts in demand for commercial properties.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Low interest rates can boost real estate prices by making mortgages more affordable and reducing borrowing costs for developers. Tightening monetary policy may lead to higher mortgage rates, potentially dampening demand for real estate.

3. **Precious Metals**:
   - **Productivity Growth**: Productivity growth typically has a minimal direct impact on precious metals prices, as they are often seen as safe-haven assets rather than tied to economic productivity.
   - **Debt Levels**: High debt levels and concerns about currency devaluation can drive investors towards precious metals as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
   - **Global Trade State**: Precious metals like gold may benefit during times of geopolitical tensions or market volatility when investors seek safe-haven assets.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Loose monetary policy, especially when accompanied by concerns about currency debasement, tends to support precious metals prices. Tightening monetary policy may have the opposite effect.

4. **Bonds**:
   - **Productivity Growth**: Higher productivity growth can lead to expectations of higher future interest rates, potentially reducing bond prices.
   - **Debt Levels**: High debt levels may increase concerns about creditworthiness and default risk, leading to higher bond yields and lower bond prices.
   - **Global Trade State**: Bond prices may be influenced by global economic conditions, including trade tensions that impact growth and inflation expectations.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Bond prices typically rise when interest rates fall (and vice versa), making monetary policy decisions by central banks a crucial factor in bond investing.

5. **Cash**:
   - **Productivity Growth**: Cash investments may offer lower returns compared to other assets during periods of strong productivity growth, as returns on cash are typically tied to prevailing interest rates.
   - **Debt Levels**: High debt levels may increase the attractiveness of holding cash as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty.
   - **Global Trade State**: Cash investments are generally less affected by global trade dynamics compared to other asset classes.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Cash investments are directly impacted by monetary policy decisions, with higher interest rates leading to higher returns on cash investments and vice versa.

6. **Cryptocurrencies**:
   - **Productivity Growth**: Cryptocurrencies are not directly tied to productivity growth but may attract investor interest during periods of technological innovation and adoption.
   - **Debt Levels**: High debt levels and concerns about currency debasement can drive demand for cryptocurrencies as alternative stores of value.
   - **Global Trade State**: Cryptocurrencies can be influenced by global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions, as they are often seen as borderless assets.
   - **Monetary Policy**: Cryptocurrency prices may be impacted by monetary policy decisions, especially in regions where there are concerns about currency devaluation or capital controls.

In summary, investing in different asset classes is influenced by a combination of factors including productivity growth, debt levels, global trade state, and monetary policy. Understanding how these drivers interact can help investors make informed decisions to build diversified portfolios that are resilient to various economic conditions and market dynamics.
